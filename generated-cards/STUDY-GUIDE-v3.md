---

### Path 2: Circuit Analysis Mastery

**Filter:** `tag:energietechniek::netwerk-analyse::* OR tag:energietechniek::RLC-systemen::*`

**Why:** Thévenin, Norton, impedance core exam skills

**Cards:** 32 total

**Study order:**
1. Thévenin basics (R33, R37, R47)
2. Norton conversion (R50)
3. RLC series (R06, R31, R38)
4. RLC parallel (R19, R42, R60)
5. Resonance (R22, R56, R62a, R62b, R66)

---

### Path 3: Practical Applications

**Filter:** `tag:energietechniek::praktijk::*`

**Why:** Real-world context improves retention + motivation

**Cards:** 10 total

**Topics:**
- Cable sizing (R16, R32, R45)
- Voltage drop (R20)
- Energy costs (R13, R28, R52, R65)
- Safety (K12, R57)

---

## 🧠 Learning Techniques

### 1. Active Recall (Core Principle)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Read the question and immediately reveal answer
- ❌ Passively recognize correct formula
- ❌ Rate "Good" if you peeked

**DO:**
- ✅ Cover answer, speak solution out loud
- ✅ Write calculation steps on paper
- ✅ Only reveal after genuine attempt
- ✅ Rate "Again" if you couldn't explain to someone else

**Why:** Retrieval strengthens memory +40% vs passive review

---

### 2. Elaborative Interrogation

**For every card, ask:**
- "Waarom?" (Why does this formula work?)
- "Wat als..." (What if I change this value?)
- "Hoe herken ik dit?" (How do I recognize this problem type?)

**Example (Card R05):**
```
Question: Motor cos φ calculation

Don't just: "cos φ = P/S = 60/68 = 0.88"

Also ask yourself:
- Why is cos φ always ≤ 1? (Definition P/S, P ≤ S)
- What if cos φ = 0? (Pure reactive, no useful work)
- How would I improve cos φ? (Add compensation capacitors)
- What happens to current if I improve cos φ? (Decreases!)
```

**Benefit:** Deep understanding, not rote memorization

---

### 3. Interleaving

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Study all "vermogen" cards in one session
- ❌ Complete one domain before moving to next

**DO:**
- ✅ Mix different domains in each session
- ✅ Use Anki's default algorithm (it interleaves automatically)
- ✅ Create custom filtered decks alternating topics

**Why:** Discrimination learning +25% retention

---

### 4. Spaced Repetition (Anki's Superpower)

**Trust the algorithm:**
- If Anki shows a card "too soon" → it knows you're forgetting
- If a card doesn't appear for weeks → you've mastered it
- "Again" ratings aren't failure → they're data for optimization

**Optimal review schedule:**
- Day 1: Learn card
- Day 3: First review
- Day 7: Second review
- Day 14: Third review
- Day 30: Fourth review
- etc. (exponential intervals)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Cram all cards in one day
- ❌ Skip reviews (breaks the algorithm)
- ❌ Always rate "Easy" (inflates intervals)

---

## 🎓 Card Type Strategies

### Formula Concept Cards (n=10)

**Goal:** Deep understanding, not just formula memorization

**Study approach:**
1. Read question 2-3 times
2. Visualize the physical situation
3. Attempt explanation in own words
4. Check answer for completeness
5. Rate "Good" only if you could teach this to someone

**Example:** K01 (Condensator faseverschil)
- Don't just memorize "i = C dU/dt"
- Understand: current depends on rate of voltage change
- Visualize: sin(ωt) → derivative → cos(ωt) = 90° shift

---

### Calculation Problem Cards (n=59)

**Goal:** Procedural fluency, speed, accuracy

**Study approach:**
1. Cover answer completely
2. Write solution on paper (units!)
3. Check each step individually
4. If ANY step wrong → rate "Again"
5. Redo wrong cards immediately

**Common mistakes:**
- Forgetting √3 in three-phase formulas
- Unit errors (mA vs A, mH vs H)
- Sign errors in complex numbers
- Mixing series vs parallel formulas

**Pro tip:** Create error log for repeated mistakes

---

### Circuit Analysis Cards (n=6)

**Goal:** Systematic problem-solving

**Study approach:**
1. Draw circuit if not provided
2. Label all known values
3. Identify analysis method (KCL, KVL, Thévenin, etc.)
4. Solve step-by-step
5. Verify answer makes physical sense

**Sanity checks:**
- Kirchhoff: ΣI_in = ΣI_out (current conserved)
- Power: P ≥ 0 (can't generate power from passive elements)
- Efficiency: η ≤ 1 (can't exceed 100%)

---

### Comparison Cards (n=4)

**Goal:** Discrimination, avoid confusion

**Study approach:**
1. First, try to recall BOTH sides
2. Identify key difference
3. Explain WHY the difference exists
4. Create mnemonic if needed

**Example:** K08 (Serie vs parallel resonance)
- Serie: Z↓ at f₀ (impedance minimum)
- Parallel: Z↑ at f₀ (impedance maximum)
- Mnemonic: "Serie Sees Small Z, Parallel Peaks"

---

### Error Analysis Cards (n=2)

**Goal:** Avoid common exam mistakes

**Study approach:**
1. Identify the error BEFORE reading answer
2. Explain WHY it's wrong
3. Show correct method
4. Add to personal error checklist

**⭐ These are GOLD:** Common mistakes account for 40% of exam point loss

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Anki Statistics

**Check weekly:** Tools → Stats

**Key metrics:**
- **Mature cards:** Should increase steadily (goal: 95%+ by exam)
- **Retention rate:** Target 85-90% (if lower, reduce new cards/day)
- **Review time:** If >2 min/card average, deck may be too difficult
- **Again rate:** If >25%, you're learning too fast (reduce new cards)

**Green flags:** ✅
- Steady increase in mature cards
- Retention 85-90%
- Review time 1-2 min/card
- Again rate 15-20%

**Red flags:** ⚠️
- Retention <80% (reduce new cards, increase review time)
- Review time >3 min/card (some cards need splitting)
- Again rate >30% (learning too fast, burnout risk)
- Skipping review days (breaks spaced repetition)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: LaTeX formulas not rendering

**Symptoms:** You see `\( U = I \cdot R \)` instead of formatted equation

**Solution:**
1. Tools → Preferences → LaTeX
2. Ensure dvipng/dvisvgm paths are set
3. Windows: Install MiKTeX (https://miktex.org)
4. Mac: Install MacTeX
5. Linux: `sudo apt install texlive-latex-base dvipng`
6. Restart Anki

---

### Problem: Cards feel overwhelming

**Symptoms:** Taking >5 min per card, high Again rate (>30%)

**Solution:**
1. Reduce new cards to 1-2/day
2. Increase review time per session
3. Create simplified notes for difficult concepts
4. Use suspensions for advanced cards until basics mastered
5. Consider using KENNIS deck first, then REKENEN

---

### Problem: Forgetting cards quickly

**Symptoms:** Retention <80%, many lapses

**Solution:**
1. Are you doing ACTIVE recall? (Cover answer, genuinely try)
2. Are you reviewing daily? (Skipping breaks algorithm)
3. Reduce new cards (focus on consolidation)
4. Add personal mnemonics to cards (Edit → Add note)
5. Create summary sheets linking related concepts

---

### Problem: Too many reviews piling up

**Symptoms:** 100+ reviews due, overwhelming

**Solution:**
1. Pause new cards (set to 0/day)
2. Do 50 reviews/day until caught up
3. Don't skip days (compounds problem)
4. Adjust ease factor (Tools → Preferences → Review)
5. Consider deck reorganization (suspend non-critical cards)

---

## 🎯 Exam Preparation (Final 2 Weeks)

### Week -2: Intensive Review
